title: Methodology for Calculating Groundwater Anamolies
---

In this project, we explored groundwater anomalies in the Colorado River Basin, making use of satellite data and ground-based observations. We utilized three key datasets - namely, GRACE data from [NASA](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/get-data/jpl_global_mascons/), GLDAS data from [NASA](https://hydro1.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/data/GLDAS/GLDAS_NOAH025_M.2.1/doc/README_GLDAS2.pdf), and Surface Water from [USGS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) and [USBR](https://www.usbr.gov/uc/water/hydrodata/nav.html).
Transitioning to the next phase, we read in and shaped them into a digestible, tabular format. Our focus then narrowed down to our region of interestâ€“the Colorado River Basin.
It then became necessary to standardize the units of measurement and resolution of these datasets. We then merged them into a unified whole, creating a comprehensive estimate of groundwater anomalies for the region. This intricate process is illustrated below:
