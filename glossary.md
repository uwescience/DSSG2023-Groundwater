# Glossary 

### Hydrologics and Water Terms

**River Basin:** an area of land drained by a river and its tributaries.      

**Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS):** the summation of all water on the land surface and below the surface. 

**Groundwater:** water present beneath the Earth's surface that exists in saturated zones. 

**Surface Water:** water that is present on top of land, forming terrestrial waterbodies, such as lakes, rivers or reservoirs. 

**Aquifer:** A body of saturated rock undergound through which water can easily move. 

**Snow Water Equivalent (SWE):** describes the amount of liquid water stored in snow pack. For example, if 10 inches of snow falls at 10% density, then there would be 1 inch of SWE. 

**Root Zone Soil Moisture:** Water stored in soil that is available to plants, generally considered to be in the upper 200 centimeters of soil. 

### Technical Terms

**GRACE:** Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment is a collaboration of the U.S. and German space agencies (NASA and DLR) that launched twin satellites on March 17, 2002 that make detailed measurements of Earth's gravity field changes. 

**GLDAS:** Global Land Data Assimilation System ingests setallite- and ground-based observational data products, using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques to generate optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes resulting in a massive archibe of modeled and obseved, global, surface meteorological data, parameter maps, and output.
