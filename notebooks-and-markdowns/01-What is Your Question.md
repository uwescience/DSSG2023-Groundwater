# Welcome to Your Groundwater Data Journey

If you're visiting this website, you're likely interested in understanding how to leverage satellite data for groundwater measurement, specifically using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data.

## What can you do with this website?

We've designed this website to streamline the process of accessing and understanding groundwater data, making it easier for those who may have encountered hurdles in the past. By following our comprehensive guide, you'll learn how to work effectively with groundwater data for any region you're interested in.

Specifically, this website will equip you to:
- Download the necessary datasets for groundwater calculation.
- Process and aggregate these datasets to derive meaningful groundwater data.
- Validate the integrity of the groundwater data obtained.
- Visualize the data in informative and engaging ways.

## Further steps you can take after visiting this website?

After you've obtained and familiarized yourself with groundwater and GRACE data, a multitude of exciting projects and applications await that extend beyond this website's scope. To help you embark on your journey, we've compiled some suggestions and useful resources:

- Understand how to quantify groundwater depletion over a specific region of interest, as demonstrated in this [paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/2014GL061055) by Castle et. al (2014). 
- Explore the correlation between water storage data and climate, flooding, and deforestation data through this insightful [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825214000932#f0020) by Ahmed et. al (2010). 
- Identify regions grappling with renewable groundwater stress, as illustrated in this enlightening [paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/2015WR017349 by Richey et. al (2015).
